## Asteroids &#129704;

This is an experimental app I created to learn to add 3D graphics to a React Web App. 

You can browse daily close encounter asteroids. The app will render 3D models of asteroids, Earth and a probe with Three.js / React Three Fiber. The app also uses React Query for fetching the data. 

Data is provided by [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). Please note that to use this app frequently, you need to create your own API key.

I have developed this app in three phases. First on Nov 2022, then Mar 2023 and finally Dec 2025.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
